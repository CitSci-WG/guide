# A Citizen Science Guide for Research Libraries

#CS4RL

From the LIBER Citizen Science Working Group.

A book to be released incrementally in sections before the end of 2021. 

## Mission statement

The guide is designed to be a practical and compact gateway publication for the purpose of assisting research libraries to start setting up a Citizen Science programme.
Citizen Science for research libraries is a way to build new and more engaged audiences as a way to establish new links between science and society.
The guide will address the unique context of research libraries – as becoming the ‘go to place’ for the new and exciting Open Science data world that is opening up to the wider public.

As a starting point the guide will use four recommendations for Citizen Science from the LIBER Open Science Roadmap: 

  - As being active in the development of infrastructure for researchers to carry out Citizen Science; 
  - as managing bodies around knowledge libraries that can translate good [Open Science] scholarly practice into new Citizen Science fields; 
  - develop guidelines for Citizen Science activities involving the library, and; 
  - Citizen Science skills development for staff, researchers, and public.
